# SigmaCore-RISC-V-CPU-Design
The SigmaCore CPU Design Project aims to develop a custom RISC-V CPU using Sys- temVerilog. This project will encompass the entire design flow—from RTL description and simulation to synthesis and FPGA implementation—thus providing a comprehensive, hands- on experience in modern CPU design.

# Level 01

Creating the Register Set. 

In RISC-V architecture there is a register set with 32 registers each 32 bits (for RV32I).
