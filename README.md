# SigmaCore-RISC-V-CPU-Design
The SigmaCore CPU Design Project aims to develop a custom RISC-V CPU using Sys- temVerilog. This project will encompass the entire design flow—from RTL description and simulation to synthesis and FPGA implementation—thus providing a comprehensive, hands- on experience in modern CPU design.
